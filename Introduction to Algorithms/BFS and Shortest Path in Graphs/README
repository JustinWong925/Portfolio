List.c
   This file is a list module. It is a doubly linked list, 
   with nodes that have a next, curr and prev pointer.
   
List.h
   This is a header file that contains the public functions to be used
   It allows other files to access the functions of List.c
   
GraphTest.c
   This file starts with the GraphClient.c given to us on the class website and
   demonstrates more of the functionality of graph.c
   
Graph.c
   A graph data structure implemented with list class. It has a BFS searching
   algorithm.

Graph.h
   This is a header file that contains the public functions to be used
   It allows other files to access the functions of Graph.c
   
FindPath.c
   The main program where a file is read in, and stores it into a matrix.
   It is able to find distance and paths using the BFS algorithm.   

Makefile
   Compiles the files together
