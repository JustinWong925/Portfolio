CMPS 112: Functional Programming Langauges

This course focuses on the different types of programming languages that are not object-oriented. 
In particular we focused on using Haskell, a language that is very useful in using pattern-matching.
Using the book, "Learn You A Haskell" we covered from the basics of syntax to the more powerful monads.
In addition we had a brief section on the Prolog language and some Javascript.

There was also a final project that was completed in Haskell. There are more details in the project directory.
