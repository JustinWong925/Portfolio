Generic Text Based Adventure
The ability to create a text-based adventure. All that is necessary is a text file in the correct format which is then
parsed into a data structure, and this program will allow your to have a text-based adventure game. 
Using typing (I/O) which is usually a problem inthe functional programming language of Haskell to navigate through this game. 

This project creates a linked list type data structure in a purely functional programming language (Haskell).
All the code is wriiten in Haskell, dealing with I/O and pattern matching to move through the linked list.

To install and run: in a Haskell environment, compile with ghc and run the exectuable (GenericText), the program will
ask what story to play and will parse and organize the game environment into the room list data type.
