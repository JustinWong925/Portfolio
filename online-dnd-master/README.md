CMPS 183: Web Applications

This project is a way to play Dungeons and Dragons online, it creates a webpage that is updated in real-time with multiple players. This
project was written in a combination of HTML, Javascript, Python, and CSS. It is deployed using web2py. 
To view the files individually go to the directory OnlineDnD.
To install using web2py: go in the web2py directory and install the package. 

We had created this project using SCRUM and agile methodology as such we have created: Release Plan, Sprint Plans and Reports, Testing and Buglist.

It is shown on a 2D game-board with different dots along the matrix labelled with different names for each of the players. There is a log-in required.
There are two types of users in this:
1. Dungeon Master: Has access to mulitple characters and is able to control the size of the board.
2. Regular Player: Only has access to one character.

There is also a chat room that we created is displayed alongside the gameboard, with commands for rolling dice.
There are different menus available for viewing character sheets which display skills and statistics about the character.
