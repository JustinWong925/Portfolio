CMPE 150/L: Introduction to Computer Networks

This course is about computer networks. There was a lab associated with the course where
I had experienced working with physical Cisco routers and switches. In order to practice with this
it was necessary to learn some shell scripting, coding in Python, and of course how computer networks
are set up in the first place. The lab covered: 
1. Setting up a virtual machine, how to analyze packet sniffer results,
2. Show HTTP and DNS are used, 
3. The mechanisms of TCP including packet loss and congestion avoidance, 
4. Creating a firewall to allow certain types of traffic through the network, and 
5. Programming a simple router to connect different devices and allow traffic through them.
