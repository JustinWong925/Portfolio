This is a more advanced listing site than the original. There have been more features added.

It features a register/log-in. It is no longer necessary to log-in or sign-up before viewing posts.
Users now have a voting associated them, that is shown on each listing that they create. It is possible to vote up
or vote down on their reputation. Each user is only allowed to vote for another once, if voted up and clicked on the 
"vote up" button once again their vote will be cancelled out and revert (from +1 to 0), same goes for the vote down (-1 to 0).

There is a feature to now display only the items that are still available for sale. Although by default all listings are shown.  

The files listed included in this directory are ones that I directly modified.
To run install through web2py.
