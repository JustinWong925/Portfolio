This project is SlugLife a mobile application (iOS) that is used for social gatherings.
The idea is that in a campus that is so widespread with varying college cultures and schedules
there needs to be a good way to find all thast information. A single place to view all campus events.
The documentation for this product is listed as per common Software Developement methodologies.

This class was a simulation of a product release. We practiced almost daily SCRUM meetings, and stuck to a
3 sprint per release schedule. It is was important that we had managed ourselves for the most part, the professor
and teaching assistant only served as moderators if the situation had come to that. For each sprint, we had 
taken turns being the SCRUM master and product manager.
